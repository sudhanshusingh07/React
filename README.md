# What is React?

- React is a JavaScript library that focuses on declarative syntax and 
virtualization of DOM.
- It is an open-source library, developed by Facebook in 2013.
- It provides a declarative and efficient way to create interactive UI 
components.
- It allows building more reusable and maintainable UI components with ease.
  
# Why React? SPA vs Traditional HTML
- Traditional Page Lifecycle

  Once the user accesses the page and performs any kind of action on that page, the page gets 
   reloaded with the changes that were done on the server-side.

- Single Page Application (SPA) Lifecycle

   Once the user accesses the page and performs any kind of action on that page, they get an 
  almost-instant reaction from the page (think of Facebook, when you comment on someone's post)

 # Virtual DOM & Rendering Flow
 - Initial Render: React builds a Virtual DOM (VDOM) tree to represent the UI in memory.
 - State Change: When state or props change, React creates a new VDOM tree.
 - Diffing Algorithm: React compares the new VDOM with the previous one to detect 
   changes.
 - Efficient Update: Only the changed parts of the real DOM are updated, improving 
   performance

 # Props & PropTypes
## Props (Properties)
- Props are inputs to a React component.
- They allow data to flow from parent to child.
- Props are read-only and help make 
- components reusable.
